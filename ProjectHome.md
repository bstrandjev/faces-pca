This is the project for my master thesis. It consists of principal component analysis of facial images. The goal is to process the input images in a way that they will be easier to classify and aggregate.

The project also includes simple android application that will be used by trainers of the algorithm. The application is designed in such a way that the classifying an image is as easy as possible.

The communication between the Android client and the main desktop application is halfway manual, meaning that the Android client is configured to send an email with the results of the classification. Then the email contents need to be fetched by hand and inserted in the desktop application's database.
